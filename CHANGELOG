v 0.10.4. Fix for unicode handling under Ruby 2.x.

v 0.10.3. Oh god oh god I left logging information in now it is gone again.

v 0.10.2. Generated counter columns no longer clobber columns with data you want. "Session" is the most common example.

v.0.10.0. Actually make things like counter columns work again. Sorry, anyone who downloaded 0.9.x.

v0.9.1. Change dependency from rparsec to rparsec-ruby19

v0.9.0. Ruby 1.9 compatibility.

v0.8.1. Remove --filter-columns option from eprime2tabfile

v0.8.0. Compatibility Warning: Lots of stuff has changed with the way column definition strings are computed. Test your existing scripts after updating! Architecture changes: Completely rewrote parser. String-based expressions now deprecate lambdas, though they'll continue to work in the future. This change fixes lots of odd bugs in defining computed columns and filters. Bug fixes: The --columns and --filter-columns options for eprime2tabfile now work.

v0.6.9.1. Bug fix: Fix for parsing eprime log files in which leaf frames don't occur at the highest log level

v0.6.9. New features: Supports parsing raw tab-delmimted files; Allows Procs as starting values for ComputedColumns. Bug fixes: No longer jumbles the order of Eprime log files

v0.6.5. New features: Speed! Speed! Speed! Should be something like 10x faster. Procs are now allowed in ComputedColumns -- so if you want to do really arbitrary things in your column computation, have at it.

v0.6.0. New features: Added extract_timings, a script to pull stimulus timing data from eprime files; Added a GenericRunner -- a class that greatly eases end-to-end transformation of eprime data. See extract_timings for an example of its use.

v0.5.5. New features: Supports making multiple passes through data, to allow extracting multiple stimuli that occur on the same row; Created a general-purpose stimulus extractor to pull data out in the format: stimulus \t onset__time \t offset__time. Architectural changes: Created a BasicTransformer that performs all of the basic operations to datasets: column calculation, row filtering, and multipass; Moved ColumnCalculator, RowFilter, and Multipasser into a Transformers module; Support release via hoe / rubygems

v0.5. First public gem release; Supports converting general Eprime files into tab-delimited files; Supports converting Eprime files into AFNI stim_times files
